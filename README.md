This project focuses on encoding and decoding a specialized language using a barcode-like system. The system utilizes a sequence of characters resembling musical notation symbols to represent different words or phrases. The aim is to create a tool that can convert these visual representations back into readable text.

Project Goal
The goal is to create a functional solution that translates the unique characters (like 𝄀, 𝄂, 𝄃) into meaningful text. These symbols will represent various elements of a language, and the tool will be able to decode them back into the original phrase or instructions.

Features
Encode a series of symbols into a barcode-like format.
Decode the visual barcode back into readable text.
Identify missing or incomplete sequences and suggest fixes to ensure proper decoding.

Usage
To encode a message: Input a phrase to be converted into the specialized barcode language.
To decode a message: Input a barcode sequence, and the tool will convert it back into readable text.
